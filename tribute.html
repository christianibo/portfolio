    <p> Since my father died, my mom started to stand all alone. She stands us a mother/father figure to us.<br>
     She raised her 5 children all by herself and that's why I'm so proud of her. She sacrificed a lot just to take care of us.
    <br>I am thankful to God for giving me such a great mother. I belived myself that I am strong because a strong woman raised me.
